## Motto

According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including (...) *housing*.

A typical building takes around two years to be built, involves huge human resources, time and money, resulting in an unaffordable privilege to a rising amount of people. Moreover inequality in the distribution of services across tne territory (mostly concentrated around big cities), paired with inflexible buiding codes generate even more demand and tension.

We coined the problem as The hamster wheeel effect. Since cities accumulate most of the resources, people tend to accumulate in the surroundings. Since housing is scarce, the demand naturally increases the cost of living. Once in the city you have no access to the natural resources that the planet gave us, everything from water, to food, to energy must be purchased. As your dependency to the city increases, people are willing to accept worse job conditions to maintain the wheel spinning. But one day, you loose your job and the wheel suddenly stops. You have no access to house, no access to food, no access to water, no access to energy, no access to communications. You have nothing. Even worse, restarting the wheel is difficult in those conditions.

Project Nest is an innovative housing concept based on sustainability, technology and modular design. Initially aimed to the market of a single person, it grows and shrinks as life needs evolve. With the help of modern computing and digital fabrication, and a vast trajectory in traditional real estate, a group of talented people are set to change housing and communities to match human rights standards.

## Applications and benefits of Microshelters

- Homeless. Improve life of affected people
- Refugees and conflict zones migrants
- Long-term Environmental disasters. More stable than temporary tents
- Use of abandon spaces
- Activate urban spaces
	- Generate/attract itinerary services providers
	- Microshelter Communities as activity attractor
- Middle class migrants. Nomads of the digital economy.
- Persons who want to discover world, look for adventure and freedom while traveling light.
- Reconnect with nature

## Idea behind Project Nest

Project Nest orbits around the ecosystem of microshelters.

- Product: An open source, modular and self-sufficient home for the market of **one** person. Deployable solution, every bolt and tool provided. Fully functional ($$)
- Design Studio: Research and development of microshelters ($$, funding)
- Platform: A fablabs.io like platform to show all stakeholders of the ecosystem.
	- Mapping microshelters
	- Mapping vendors, constructors, material sellers ($$)
- Mobile app to purchase microshelters ($$)
- Education: Digital fabrication, design and construction of microshelters ($$)

- ($$) = Could be monetized
- (funding) = Could receive public/private funding


## Design and Prototyping tools

- Blender (realistic visualizations, VR, 2D animation)
- Threejs (website)
- Flutter (mobile apps)
- Othermill/mdx20 (circuits, molds)
- Shaper Origin
- vinyl cutter
